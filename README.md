### Class exercises
* Problem 1.4: Metronome

Write a VI called Metronome, whose front panel includes a numeric control labeled "Beats per Minute". When run, construct Metronome so that it produces N beeps every minute until the stop button is pressed, where N is the value entered in the "Beats per Minute control and a beep is a 264 Hz sound wave of 100 ms duration. You can find beep function in LabView.

* Problem 2.6: DraggingDresser

It's moving day and you are dragging a heavy dresser at constant velocity across the horizontal floor of your new apartment. The force you are applying to the dresser has magnitude F and it is directed at angle θ above the horizontal The weight of the dresser is W and the coefficient of kinetic friction between it and the floor is μ. (F' = F/ W)

(a) Write a for-loop based program called DraggingDresser that given μ from a numeric control label Coefficient of Kinetic Friction, calculates F' from θ=0 to θ=90 in 1 degree increments and then displays the resulting array of F' values on a waveform graph as well as in an array indicator labeled Force.

(b) Run DraggingDresser with μ=0.1, μ=0.4, and μ=1.0. Determine the θ<sub>min</sub> at which F' is smallest in each case.
